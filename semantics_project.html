          Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for
          different purposes. Thus, some static dos and donts are always of use
          in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has three
          common features: maintainability, dependability, and usability. It
          should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing
          environments. However, before coding even begins, a few prerequisites
          need to be fulfilled in order to provide a solid foundation on which
          readable code can be written.
        </p>
        <section id="prerequisites">
          <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
          <p>
            This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these,
            a code may be inefficient even if it is completed. The prerequisites
            that need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters like
            design and architecture. An important question is how development is
            structured. What is the specific purpose of the software? The
            problem that the code is meant to solve must be clear to the
            developer. What is the design of the individual components? Such
            basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a good code is being
            written.

              <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
              <p>
                Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by
                programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple
                programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge
                transfer.

              <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
              <p>
                Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding.
                Often developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not
                replace them with meaningful names.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
              <p>
                The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain
                result, developers may use complex logic but this should be
                minimised while writing a good code. The next developer who uses
                the code may use it for a different purpose and may not even
                completely understand or utilise the complex logic.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
              <p>
                Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code
                contains values referring to absolute parameters such as file
                names, URLs or IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is
                of a different design.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>TESTING</h3>
              <p>
                Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test
                cases must be planned while the code is being written, and they
                are developed while an application is coded.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3>
              <p>
                While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors
                throughout. Though it is fine for smaller programs to be
                debugged after they have been written, this becomes a bottleneck
                for longer programmes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
              <p>
                Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The
                installation files should be kept to a minimum and updated
                regularly.
