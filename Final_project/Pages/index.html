        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Coding is like Maths. Learning theory or watching videos is not
          enough. You have to practise solving problems, work on areas of
          weakness and build topic level mastery to gain the confidence you need
          to tackle real world problems head on. Therefore, Coding Ninjas has
          come up with a unique '3-Stage-Learning-Model'. In the Learn Stage, we
          offer a seamless learning experience with lectures, problem solving
          modules and projects. We gamify the whole learning experience through
          leaderboards and awards to keep it engaging and fun. You can
          effortlessly track your coding journey and the progress you’ve made
          week by week, mapping your path to success. If you ever need extra
          time to catch up, no worries, our platform adapts to your pace, making
          learning stress-free. In the Excel Stage, basis the progress you’ve
          made in the Learn Stage, we help you identify areas of improvement at
          a topic level and give you additional resources to bridge your skill
          gaps so that you can excel in your chosen field of interest. In the
          Standout Stage, we help you stand out with recruiters on platforms
          like Naukri, by building a coding profile on Code 360 through
          participation in weekly coding contents, events and so on. We also
          give you personalised feedback and interview insights. By the time you
          graduate, you would not just be a coder. You’d be a Coding Ninja!

          <blockquote>
            <dd>
              "I started my data structures and algorithms journey from coding
              ninjas. The most important aspect to get started onto anything is
              to build your base. I guarantee, that coding ninjas will do that
              for you. They have some of the best faculty going around. I
              trained under Nidhi mam, and she was the best teacher I came
              across. At the end, I would recommend coding ninjas if you want to
              get started."
